Sharing things with you.

## About Me
Hello, everyone there. I am a fulltime frontend developer from China and programming in JavaScript since 2018.

I love JAVASCRIPT so much for its `Easy to run`, `Flexibility`, `Functional Features` and more.

I love PAINTING, filling colors on a paper of sketch or on a webpage is a happiness to me.

I love STUDY, programming, drawing, dance(PDD) and all other things related to them.

I currently study go which is a programming language designed for doing concurrency.

## What is this REPO?
This repo is where I will like to share things with you, no plan to use a blog or something else equivalent.

## Update Frequency
No Plan at all, depending on my own schedule.
